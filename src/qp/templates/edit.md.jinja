## Task

{% if copy %}
### Copyediting

- check spelling for correctness and consistency
- check grammar (verb-subject agreement, dangling participles, unclear pronouns, punctuation) for correctness and consistency
- ensure that text aligns with information in tables and figures and that bibliographic citations match the reference list
- check that tables, figures, and annexes are correctly cited in the text
- ensure that all cross-references to chapters, sections, and subsections are correct
- check formatting of chapters, sections, and paragraphs for consistency
- ensure that essential abbreviations are spelled out at first mention
- check that word usage is appropriate
- delete excessive italics, boldface, and quotation marks
{% endif %}

{% if substantive %}
### Substantive editing

- revise chapter titles, subheadings, and figure/table legends for brevity, consistency, and accurate numbering
- reorganize sections or paragraphs to improve logical flow and reader comprehension
- identify gaps in reasoning or evidence and suggest additions or clarifications
- eliminate redundant passages, verbatim repetition, and digressions while preserving essential content
- flag opportunities to tighten arguments, transitions, and narrative focus
{% endif %}

{% if not copy and not substantive %}
- Follow the user instructions closely, making only the minimal edits they explicitly request.
{% endif %}

Return only the edited text.
