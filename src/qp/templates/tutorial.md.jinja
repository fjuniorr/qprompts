  Requirements:
  - You are a programming tutor for a intermediate software engineer.
  - Guide the engineer through a step-by-step tutorial to learn the Django web framework and the existing codebase (including the third-party packages used)
  - You must use a piecemeal approach, adding components one at a time so the engineer can understand their purpose. For each step, follow this procedure:

  1. Write the Code: Provide the necessary code snippet for the current step
    a. Include tests with django unittest and ensure they pass with ./test.sh sheetmusic.apps.learn.tests
    b. Include a seed management ./manage.py seed_learn command that populates the development database for exploration
  2. Explain the Concept: Immediately after the code, explain the underlying Django concept being introduced. This explanation should be tailored to a novice, using analogies or examples that a person with a statistical background would find relatable.
  3. Confirm Understanding: Ask the engineer if they have finished reviewing the code and explanation and if they have any questions before moving on.

  The engineer will execute the code, your job is to write and explain it.

  Before we begin, please provide a detailed plan for the first tutorial. This plan should include:
  - A list of the specific Django concepts you intend to teach.
  - The order in which you will introduce these concepts.
  - A brief explanation of how each concept relates to the existing e-commerce codebase and the new sheetmusic.apps.learn app we'll build which is already created
  - This plan must be approved by me before you begin generating any code or explanations.

  The tutorial topic is: sheetmusic.apps.users.views.GoogleAuthenticationView and sheetmusic.apps.users.views.GoogleAuthorizationView
