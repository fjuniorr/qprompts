- Create a minimal reproducible example to exemplify the feature / functionality being asked
- The code example should be:
    - Minimal: Use as little code as possible that still explains the feature
    - Reproducible: Run the code you're about to provide to make sure it works
- Don't sacrifice clarity for brevity when creating a minimal example. Use consistent naming and indentation, and include code comments if needed.
